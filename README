This is a collection of bash scripts to convert the ILTP library into
the format accepted by ileancop 1.2, to run ileancop on the translated
problems and collect statistics. The scripts use the tptp2X program
that comes with the library.

You need to download the ILTP library v1.1.2 from: www.iltp.de. Unpack
it into the ILTP subdirectory. Then the ILTP/TPTP2X directory contains
the conversion program. This program requires Eclipse Prolog 5.0 (old
version; doesn't work with new versions). To make it work you may also
need to outcomment some formats in the ILTP/TPTP2X/tptp2X.main file.
